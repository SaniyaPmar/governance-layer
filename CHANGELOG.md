## [2.0.0](https://github.com/SaniyaPmar/governance-layer/compare/v1.4.0...v2.0.0) (2026-09-27)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **audit:** merkle_root now domain-separates leaves from internal nodes, so every Merkle root it produces changes. Audit-log anchor sidecars (`<path>.root`) written by earlier releases no longer match their own untouched chain and must be regenerated — appending any record re-anchors the log, or the sidecar can be rewritten from AuditLog.batch_root().

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/Nomos-N4s/nomos/compare/v0.15.2...v1.0.0) (2026-08-18)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **audit:** merkle_root now domain-separates leaves from internal nodes, so every Merkle root it produces changes. Audit-log anchor sidecars (`<path>.root`) written by earlier releases no longer match their own untouched chain and must be regenerated — appending any record re-anchors the log, or the sidecar can be rewritten from AuditLog.batch_root().

### Features

* **benchmarks:** export mean governance latency in the analysis artifacts ([17d1a44](https://github.com/Nomos-N4s/nomos/commit/17d1a441a3c00eb68fc2f0f695841e3f95c4be8f))

## [0.8.0] — 2026-08-11

### Added
- License moved to Apache-2.0 (was CC BY 4.0); LICENSE, README, CLA, and docs references aligned
- Docker build fixed: tests/ and examples/ now copied into the image, base stage is the default build target, .dockerignore added
- MkDocs Material documentation build system (`mkdocs.yml`, `docs/`)
- GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy docs to GitHub Pages
- GitHub Project #3 for issue tracking with 4 epics (A–D)
- End-to-end pipeline integration test (mini benchmark → analysis → figures → export) (#103)
- Hypothesis property-based tests for contracts (mask merger, enforcement, timelock), Identity Layer (tier rules, multisig thresholds, ontology hashes), and TEE (watchdog, Merkle trees, constant-time ops) (#104)
- Benchmark smoke test job in CI (`benchmark-smoke` in `.github/workflows/tests.yml`) (#105)
- Formal prediction cross-validation harness (#144): 12-prediction confirmation table, adversarial edge-case catalog, sensitivity analysis, and `prove-agent` CLI subcommand
- Auto-refresh toggle for the RL Training tab: polls `results/rl/` every 30s, shows a last-updated timestamp and a "Live from Colab" indicator when new results land (#75)
- `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics` endpoints for `runner serve`: liveness, readiness (Speaker, TEE watchdog, deadlock breaker, backend), and Prometheus metrics via the optional `observability` extra (#163)

### Changed
- Aligned all four benchmark figures with analysis pipeline: reward curves use bootstrap CIs instead of parametric error; violation rate and deadlock frequency bar charts use bootstrap CI error bars instead of stdev; Pareto frontier overlay added; color palette unified across all figure types (#101)
- **Rebrand live (#86).** Package renamed `governance` → `nomos` in #205; this PR ports the docs/brand state to the published surface: `mkdocs.yml` now presents the site as **Nomos** with `site_url`/`repo_url` pointing at `xcoder-es/nomos` (repo renamed from `xcoder-es/governance-layer`, old URLs redirect). README headline, badges, and citation updated; API reference, book responses, and changelog index swept of stale `governance-layer` references; page-visible module docstrings (runner, prove, ontology) updated.
